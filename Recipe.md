Soften chopped onions in olive oil over medium heat.
Stir in garlic, spices, and tomato paste.
Throw in your vegetables and cook until tender.
Add canned whole tomatoes and break them up a bit with a spoon. You want the sauce to be chunky.
Season and then simmer the sauce until it’s reduced slightly — somewhere between 10 and 15 minutes.
While the sauce simmers, cook your pasta.
Toss the pasta with the sauce and serve.
I love serving the spaghetti with a generous amount of parmesan cheese, but if you are vegan, try sprinkling a bit of nutritional yeast on top instead.

Hope you enjoyed making (and eating of course!) the spaghetti.
